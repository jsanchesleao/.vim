# .vim

This is my personal, unified, vim plugin configuration

## Instructions
* On linux, `git clone` into __~/.vim__
* On Windows, clone into a directory called  __\_vimfiles__ in your home folder

Then, `cd` into the cloned directory and `git submodule init` to configure the plugins dependencies

Run `git submodule --update` to fetch the dependencies

Finally, to enable features, source init.vim file

This should work for *vim* and *gvim*
